Besides, we would like also thanks the followings to contribute to our project:
- @zhangbowen for contributing to timer&&clock/memory/sched subsystems, and the improvement in dynamic memory allcations of RROS. As the inital members of this project, he has already graduted from our group as a master. Good luck on his further work!
- @shetianyu for trying to rewrite the raspiberry GPIO drivers in RFL. This can be the first step to write realtime gpio drivers in RROS.
- @liguiying for running camera via opencv in RROS and trying to backport libcamera to RROS. He also explores to call Rust structers in C to write realtime drivers.
- @sunzitai for enabling the debug ability of RROS in the RPI4 and contributing to the observe factory.
- @qiuxiangkai for reproducing the reboot bug and contributing to the control factory.
