This paper, based on the development process of RROS team, conducted the first empirical research and analysis on the Linux subsystem Rust-for-Linux (RFL): First of all, it deeply explored the integration process of the Rust language and the Linux kernel, studied the performance of RFL in terms of security, performance, and ecology, and summarized the experience of using Rust for kernel development. It has important reference significance for how to use Rust for driver development under Linux. Furthermore, it conducted a preliminary study on the security of Rust drivers, laying the foundation for the subsequent construction of a secure driver subsystem.Last but not least, it conducted a detailed measurement of Rust driver performance, providing a decision-making basis for the further reconstruction of the file or network subsystem, which is conducive to the further development of the RFL subsystem.
